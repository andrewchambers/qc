* +=/-= for pointers is broken currently. Might need to be a special
  case instead of it's own node type (unlike pointer arith).

* enum support.

* actually emit cast instructions for sign extension etc.

* actually perform checks and casts for function calls.

* actually perform checks for assignment.

* properly parse C declarations, long long, long unsigned etc etc.

* char lit support

* typed int literals, 0l, 0ll, 0llu etc.

* float support

* unsigned support

* make the main unions all `T x#. This includes types, expr and stmt.
  Currently I am mixing large and small, it is inconsistent and ugly.
  
* varargs

* static array inits

* any missing forms of static initializers, such as &{...} and more advanced
  folding.

* dynamic inits

* static typeclass needs to emit anonymous labels
