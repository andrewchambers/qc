# Quick C

qc is a c frontend for the qbe ssa backend written by Quentin Carbonneaux.
qbe is currently not publicly available, but it will be, and it is awesome.

The frontend itself is written in the [Myrddin](https://myrlang.org) programming
language, a language that is under heavy development, and also rocks.
